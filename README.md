CPSC 304 Group Project

This project provides a simple interface for Clients, Employees, and Managers, to access relevant data. The data models a shipping company which has to deal with people (clients, employees, managers), their equipment (forklifts and trucks), and objects (packages, workplaces, etc). Relationships between entities are also captured; for example, workers can drive trucks and/or forklifts, and are in charge of packages which clients order.
